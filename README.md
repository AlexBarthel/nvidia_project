# Artificially Intelligent Bouncer

This Bouncer AI was created as a simpler way for facial recognition and restriction of access. Bouncers are typically seen at parties that are whitelisted; although, there are people that act as bouncers, but they are in the military, at a government building, etc. This AI could be used to simplify access and increase the efficiency of identity verification.

# ! NOTICE !

This repository has been reworked to accomodate my project. My original version on VSCode had too many technical challenges that wasted my time and got me nowhere. The ipynb file and model export here are from me recreating my project in jupyterlab. I hope that this does not cause too much confusion and this is the reason why there are so many commits and file deletions on this repository.
